GTask
-----

g_task_propagate_* --> does NOT take a ref on the task
g_task_return_* --> TAKES a ref

GTask calls the GDestroyNotify function of your *data* upon finalization. So
you shouldn't free it yourself - you'll get a double free.

_propagate_* also sets a flag called result_destroy to false - I'm a bit
confused by that - but I think what it means is - since _propagate_* doesn't
take a ref, it's up to you to call g_object_unref on it in your _cb function
that calls _finish. I think that if the operation fails somewhere along the
way, it will free your stuff for you.

Re: the _unreffing of the task in the cb function that calls finish: this
seems to be correct. gdb has confirmed this. I haven't seen many projects
actually do this though except evolution-data-server.
